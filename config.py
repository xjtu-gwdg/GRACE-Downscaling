config.py

This configuration file centralizes all paths, parameters, and constants used throughout the project 
for easy maintenance and consistent access.

Contents include:
- File and directory paths (e.g., mask file path, directories for various feature datasets, low-resolution 
  and high-resolution groundwater storage folders)
- List of features used by the model
- Time range settings (start year/month and end year/month)
- Interpolation method options (e.g., bilinear, nearest neighbor, cubic)
- Standard nodata value used to represent invalid or missing data

By defining these global variables in one place, this file enables cleaner and more consistent usage 
across scripts, improving code maintainability, readability, and ease of updates.
