train.py

This script handles the training pipeline for the groundwater storage downscaling model.
It includes dataset preparation, custom data loading and collation, training loop with
warmup cosine learning rate scheduler, loss computation with label smoothing and hinge loss,
validation evaluation, and model checkpointing with early stopping.
